# Task 
1. *User Interface Design*:
   - Create a clean and user-friendly sign-up form with fields for the username, email, password, and a confirmation password.
   - Implement form validation with clear error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., invalid email format, password too short, passwords do not match).

2. *State Management*:
   - Use Reactâ€™s state management to handle form inputs and validation states.
   - (Optional) If they are experienced, they could use a more advanced state management library like Redux or Context API.

3. *Component Structure*:
   - Break down the user interface into reusable React components (e.g., InputField, Button).
   - Ensure proper use of functional components and hooks.

4. *Styling*:
   - Use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or emotion, or CSS preprocessors like SCSS.
   - Implement responsive design to ensure the sign-up page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

5. *Federation Integration*:
   - Implement federated authentication using a popular provider like Google or Facebook.
   - Use libraries like `react-oauth-google` or `react-facebook-login` for easier integration.
   - Handle authentication flow and errors gracefully.

6. *API Integration*:
   - Set up a mock API server or use a service like MirageJS to simulate backend interactions.
   - Implement API calls to submit the sign-up form data and handle server responses.

7. *Security Practices*:
   - Ensure secure handling of user data and passwords.
   - Implement client-side validation, but also emphasize the importance of server-side validation.

8. *Testing*:
   - Write unit tests for the components and utility functions using libraries like Jest and Testing Library.
   - Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress or a similar testing framework.

9. *Documentation*:
   - Provide clear comments and documentation in the code to explain the logic and choices made during implementation.
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application.

10. *Bonus (for extra expertise)*:
    - Implement a feature to show/hide the password.
    - Add animations or transitions for a better user experience.
    - Use TypeScript for static type checking.
    - Implement accessibility features to ensure the sign-up page is accessible to as many users as possible.
